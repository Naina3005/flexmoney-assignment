                                                          PROJECT TITLE-YOGA APPLICATION 

                                                          
Problem Statement:
Assume that you are the CTO of an outsourcing firm which has been chosen to build an
admission form for the Yoga Classes which happen every month.
Requirements for the admission form are:
- Only people within the age limit of 18-65 can enroll for the monthly classes and they will
be paying the fees on a month on month basis. I.e. an individual will have to pay the fees
every month and he can pay it any time of the month.
- They can enroll any day but they will have to pay for the entire month. The monthly fee is
500/- Rs INR.
- There are a total of 4 batches a day namely 6-7AM, 7-8AM, 8-9AM and 5-6PM. The
participants can choose any batch in a month and can move to any other batch next
month. I.e. participants can shift from one batch to another in different months but in the
same month they need to be in the same batch
Solution:
The solution is a web-based admission form for Yoga Classes built using ReactJS, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, with data storage handled by Firebase Firestore. The platform, designed for both desktop and mobile views, is intended for an outsourcing firm's client. Key requirements include:

Age Limit: Participants must be within the age range of 18 to 65 to enroll in monthly yoga classes.

Payment: Monthly fees of 500/- Rs INR are to be paid on a month-to-month basis, with participants having the flexibility to pay at any time during the month.

Batch Selection: Participants can enroll on any day of the month and select one of the four daily batches: 6-7AM, 7-8AM, 8-9AM, and 5-6PM. Batch selection is fixed for the entire month, but participants can switch batches in subsequent months.

Firebase Integration: Firebase Firestore is utilized for data storage, ensuring a reliable and scalable backend for managing participant information and batch preferences.

Responsive Design: The web application is designed to be responsive, providing a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Firebase Hosting: The solution is deployed and hosted using Firebase Hosting, ensuring efficient and secure access for participants.
